# vlc-client [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mguinada/vlc-client.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mguinada/vlc-client)

vlc-client manages a [VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) instance through its RC interface.

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'vlc-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vlc-client

### Usage

##### Create a client and connect to a running VLC media player instance.

```ruby

vlc = VLC::Client.new('192.168.1.10', 9999) #Expects a VLC media player running on `192.168.1.10:9999`, e.g. `vlc --extraintf rc --rc-host 192.168.1.10:9999`

vlc.connect # connect to server
# => true

vlc.play('http://example.org/media.mp3') # play media
# => true

vlc.playing?
# => true

vlc.fullscreen
# => true
#...

```

##### Create a self managed client/server system.
If you need a local client/server VLC media player system


```ruby

vlc = VLC::System.new # A client/server system over a local managed VLC instance

vlc.connected? # auto connect
# => true

vlc.play('http://example.org/media.mp3')
# => true

vlc.progress
# => 1 #%
#...

# Technically this is the same as
vlc = VLC::Client.new(VLC::Server.new('localhost', 9595, false))
```

# Playlist management

```ruby

vlc = VLC::System.new

vlc.add_to_playlist('track1.mp3')
vlc.add_to_playlist('track2.mp3')

vlc.play

vlc.playlist
#=> [{:number=>1, :title=>"Track #1 title", :length=>"00:03:10", :times_played=>1}, {:number=>2, :title=>"Track #2 title", :length=>"00:03:30", :times_played=>0}]

```

### Notice

vlc-client has been tested on linux but it should work on any VLC installation as long as the command line is responsive for `vlc` and `cvlc` calls. On Mac OS X these are not available by default. They can be created with:

```bash
echo "alias vlc='/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC'" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "alias cvlc='/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC'" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
